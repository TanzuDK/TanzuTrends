# Scrape

The scrape application is written in Golang, and is using the [Twitter Scraper project](https://github.com/n0madic/twitter-scraper) to get the information from [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com)

Note that due to the constant changes in the Twitter API lately, there can be breaking changes, that need to be fixed, to get new data.
